# Python Series

Welcome to **Python Series**, a collection of Python scripts designed to explore and implement fundamental programming concepts, all the way to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)!

## Topics Covered
1. **Variables**  
   Learn about different types of variables, data types, and their uses.

2. **Operators**  
   Explore arithmetic, logical, comparison, and other operators.

3. **Strings**  
   Understand string manipulations, methods, slicing, and formatting.

4. **Lists**  
   Dive into Python lists, their methods, and practical applications.

5. **Tuples**  
   Learn how tuples work, their immutability, and use cases.

6. **Dictionaries**  
   Work with dictionaries, keys, values, and methods.

7. **Sets**  
   Understand the concept of sets, operations, and methods.

8. **Conditional Statements**  
   Implement `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions in code.

9. **Loops**  
   Master `for` loops, `while` loops, and nested loops.

10. **Functions**  
    Create reusable blocks of code with functions, arguments, and return values.

11. **Error Handling**  
    Learn about `try`, `except`, and `finally` to handle runtime errors.

12. **Modules**  
    Import modules and understand how to use built-in and custom  modules.

13. **File Handling**  
    Read, write, and manipulate files using Python.

14. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
    Implement classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
